# Text-Editor-in-Python

This is an ongoing project that I have been assisting with and is about coding a Text Editor in Python, using the Tkinter module. It is on early stages, and it is aimed for editing and handling of .cir files (Pspice) in an customized way.

It is being built in an OOP fashion using class objects. It has been developed under Windows OS, and it has not been tested for Linux nor MacOS.

The "main.py" file is used to start the program, and the "core_f.py" file holds the different instances required for the text editor GUI.
